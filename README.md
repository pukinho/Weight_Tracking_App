# Weight Tracking App

App for tracking weight of two people. Created using HTML, CSS, JS and CanvasJS.

Just pick the date and type the weight at that time. The graph will show up automatically.

Graph gives an opportunity to visually compare the results of two people (or one, if you won't put any data, related to Person_2).

Data you type in is stored in your local storage, so the app remembers the results next time you open it.
